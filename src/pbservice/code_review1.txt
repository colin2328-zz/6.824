Overall, the design looks good. I didn't realize that you could seperate the mapLock and the viewLock, but I'm assuming it runs fine for you. One thing I noticed, was that in your pbservice client, you did extra work to update the view- you could of simply called ck.vs.Primary() etc. each time and not kept that state up to date.

Good job.
