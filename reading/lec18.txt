Consider a Kademlia-based key-value store with a million users, with non-mutable keys: once a key is published, it will not be modified. The k/v store experiences a network partition into two roughly equal partitions A and B for 1.5 hours.

X is a very popular key. Would nodes in both A and B likely be able to access X's value (1) during the partition? (2) 10 minutes after the network is joined? (3) 25 hours after the network is joined?

Yes, during the partition, both will know A and B because the key is popular and likely cached in both partitions.
10 minutes after joining, yes, definitely, Kademilia ensures this
25 hours after the partition- not at first, because the cached values expire every 24 hours, but the original publisher will republish, and Kademilia will get the key

(optional) Would your answer change if X was an un-popular key?
During the paritition, it would change, because the value was unlikely to be cached in both parititons.
