Suppose tractserver T1 is temporarily unreachable due to a network problem, so the metadata server drops T1 from the TLT. Then the network problem goes away, but for a while the metadata server is not aware that T1's status has changed. During this time could T1 serve client requests to read and write tracts that it stores? If yes, give an example of how this could happen. If no, explain what mechanism(s) prevent this from happening.

It depends. The metadata server only gives new the new TLT list to clients once all of the new tract servers have acked that they are now handling T1's tracts. If T1 recovers before the ACKs, it will be able to handle reads, but writes are sent out to each of the servers, and if any of those servers received the new version number they will reject the request and tell the client to update its table.
