It depends. The metadata server only gives new the new TLT list to clients once all of the new tract servers have acked that they are now handling T1's tracts. If T1 recovers before the ACKs, it will be able to handle reads, but writes are sent out to each of the servers, and if any of those servers received the new version number they will reject the request and tell the client to update its table.
