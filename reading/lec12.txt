Suppose that a simplified version of Treadmarks, called Dreadmarks, simply sent all modifications of variables between an acquire and a release to the next processor to acquire the same lock. No other modifications are sent. What changes does Treadmarks send that Dreadmarks does not? Outline a specific simple situation in which Treadmarks would provide more useful or intuitive memory behavior than Dreadmarks.

Treadmarks also has the write notice messages, which are just an indication that the page has been modified (in the interval). The actual diffs are not sent until the next processor who acquires the lock requests this. This allows the page to request the diff, compare the diff, and perhaps not invalidate the page. (if the variables on the page that were changed do not collide)
