The manager part of the WriteServer sends out invalidate messages, and waits for confirmation messages indicating that the invalidates have been received and processed. Suppose the manager send out invalidates, but did not wait for confirmations. Describe a scenario in which lack of the confirmation would cause the system to behave incorrectly. You should assume that the network delivers all messages, and that none of the computers fail.

Let's say that a server is not the owner or manager of the table, but wants to read a page. It will ask for permission to read, and lock it's own threads from reading/writing. Then, before reading, the manager of the table wants to write. It sends out invalidate messages, locks the table, writes the table. The reader will then read the new value (or possibly a value in inconsistant state during the write!), even though the read request was done previously
